## Sunday Morning Breakfast Club (SMBC) Schedule and Restaurant list

The Sunday Morning Breakfast Club is a loose affiliation of SF Bay Area motorcycles who go to breakfast on Sunday mornings.   This simple iOS app (iOS 13 or later) lets users access the list of Restaurants and annual ride schedules.  It is a convenience.  All information is contained on the [SMBC web pages](https://smbc.snafu.org/).
