## Sunday Morning Breakfast Club (SMBC) Schedule and Restaurant list

The Sunday Morning Breakfast Club is a loose affiliation of SF Bay Area motorcycles riders who go to breakfast on Sunday mornings.   This simple iOS app (iOS 13 or later) lets users access the list of Restaurants and annual ride schedules.  It is a convenience for those who like apps over web pages.  All information can also be found on the [SMBC web pages](https://smbc.snafu.org/).
