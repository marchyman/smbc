// MARK: -- Pick a schedule year

/// I don't want to force a fetch of data from the server every time the picker wheel is modified.
/// Better if I wait until the few is about to go away and then cause the model to fetch needed
/// data and signal that the model has changed once the data has been received.
/// Alas, onDisappear is not called for navigation events.  I don't know if that is part of the design
/// or a beta bug.
///
/// I am triggering the update using the done button.  But... button use is optional... the user
/// could swipe the view away, instead.  This is a bug that needs to be resolved.
